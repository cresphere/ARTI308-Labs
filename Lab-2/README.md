Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open Datasets, and Drawing a Methodology Diagram.

## Dataset info and the Machine Learning Problem
The chosen dataset contains information collected from 4424 students upon enrollment into higher education. It has 36 features covering the students' academic path, demographic characteristics and social economic status such as marital status, age, gender, and parents' education and occupation. The target variable is a 3 category classification indicating the results of the students' academic path (dropout, enrolled and graduate). The goal is to predict students' outcomes and find early signs of factors that result to academic challenges, such that student retention improves.
